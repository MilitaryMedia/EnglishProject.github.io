        <p style="text-align: left;"><b style="color: gainsboro;">place</b>War is a large problem everyone knows is disastrous, but we can’t seem to fix it. Wars have a large death toll. However, wars can also cause mental health issues and environmental issues. But, most people don’t know how they can make a difference in such a large problem. So, how can you help? You’re about to find out.<br>
	    <b style="color: gainsboro;">place</b>Many people, soldiers and innocent civilians alike, die in wars. A yearly average of 526,000 people die from armed conflicts. (Databank) When people die, their families will be devastated, they might not have a source of income, and they could even change their entire lifestyle. War makes orphans and homeless people. War can reduce the population and the workforce. If someone who would have contributed to society dies, then there is no longer any contribution. How to improve the situation: start using military vehicles that don’t require a driver in the vehicle where they could die. However, what can we do to help those who survived, but now have mental health problems?<br>
	    <b style="color: gainsboro;">place</b>Soldiers who were in wars may develop mental health issues. Many soldiers have PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is when they are stuck in panic mode. They may have flashbacks or be stuck in a negative mindset. When people kill, they morally injure themselves. Therefore, we should try to reduce the opportunity for soldiers to experience traumatic events, by not placing soldiers in battle, but instead using technology that doesn't require gunners and drivers. Soldiers who already have PTSD should be able to receive special help. Moving on, what environmental problems are caused by war?<br>
	   <b style="color: gainsboro;">place</b>Wars can have a devastating impact on the environment. Military vehicles and used ammunition produce hundreds of thousands of tons of air pollution and contaminate water with oil and uranium. Radiation from nuclear bombs might stay around for years after they exploded, making the land inhabitable. Forests have been destroyed and both animal and bird populations have been affected by war. (Watson) We should try to fix this because we don’t want to destroy the planet. One way to fix it might be to invest in clean energy for vehicles and not use ammunition and bombs that will release radiation. <br>
	    <b style="color: gainsboro;">place</b>Overall, war causes many problems. Since we can’t stop war overall, we can try to reduce the death toll, help soldiers with PTSD, and help the environment. We can improve these situations by going to war in a way that fewer people are at the battlefront, trying to prevent soldiers from having to experience traumatic events, investing in clean energy for vehicles, and stopping using ammunition and bombs that produce radiation. You could help us make a difference in the world by solving some of its many problems. So, donate to AntiWar to help fix the problems of war.<br>
