        <p>AntiWar is an imaginary organization that is going to help improve the world by stopping conflicts. If you want to learn more about what we do in AntiWar read on to learn more. The purpose of AntiWar is to speak out to countries that are on the verge of war with another country and to help them negotiate a peace treaty. We would also fund countries currently at war so they can, hopefully, end the conflict faster. Next, you will read about some reasons why we are trying to make a dent in the amount of conflicts that occur globally.
<br>
One reason that we exist is that “an average of 526,000 people die each year because of armed conflicts.”(databank.worldbank.org) That isn’t good because it doesn’t just show the amount of resources that we are wasting on killing each other, it also shows that there is a lot of hatred between countries. Some examples of countries that don’t currently enjoy each other's presence would be Ukraine and Russia, they have been constantly fighting for the past TWO years! Next, we are going to focus on human needs.
<br>
The second reason that we are going to take action is that “oil and gas from military vehicles is polluting the country’s drinkable water.”(watson.brown.edu) This is a big problem that happens from war because if the citizens of the country don’t have drinkable water they will not be able to survive. There are a few ways that we could address this problem. One way would be to encourage countries to start making electric vehicles; this may work, however, they will most likely	have to make the vehicles smaller so that they can function correctly.
<br>
The final reason that we are helping is that there is “a large amount of forests that are being destroyed to some extent because of war.”(watson.brown.edu) Reasons that this is bad includes: some animals becoming extinct, beautiful views of the forests will be destroyed, and there won’t be as much wood and other supplies for building. A way that we could solve this problem would be to ask countries to make laws stating that you aren’t allowed to go into certain areas of the forests. This could work, however, during a war, there are lots of rules that get broken, so this could also not be very effective.
<br>
As said before AntiWar has goals to help countries be peaceful with each other. We try to help both the people of the country and the country itself by encouraging them to be peaceful. If our idea of peace were to work the world would be a much better place than it is now. Please consider joining us on our quest to rid the world of war.
